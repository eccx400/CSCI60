Scientists from the United States and Denmark are seeking to map out the plumbing system hidden inside the earthâ s crust that is responsible for the

famous Old Faithful geyser and other hydrothermal features at Yellowstone National Park.
Throughout November, the research team will conduct flights over the park using a giant, hoop-shaped electromagnetic system suspended from a helicopter.
The device acts like an X-ray machine to determine where and how hot water flows beneath the surface.
The team also hopes to gain insights into the infrequent but sometimes major hydrothermal explosions that occur in the park, said Carol Finn, a scientist with the United States Geological Survey. One such explosion, or possibly several, that occurred roughly 13,800 years ago left a crater that measures one and a half miles across at the bottom of Yellowstone Lake.
